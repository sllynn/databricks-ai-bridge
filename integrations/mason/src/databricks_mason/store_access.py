"""Shared Lakebase access plumbing for granting a deployed app's service principal store access.

A managed store (session or memory) is backed by a per-store Lakebase database in a shared,
service-managed project. The store's tables are owned by whoever created the store (the deploying
user), so giving the deployed app's service principal access takes TWO steps:
  1. a `postgres` app resource so the SP gets a Lakebase role and CONNECT on the database, and
  2. a table GRANT (issued over a Postgres connection as the store owner) so the SP can read/write
     the tables.
With only (1) the SP connects but hits "permission denied" on the tables; with only (2) it can't
connect at all. Both are best-effort — deploy proceeds and reports if either step can't be applied.

This module holds the store-agnostic mechanics; `session_store_access` and `memory_store_access`
supply the per-store project/schema/table specifics.
