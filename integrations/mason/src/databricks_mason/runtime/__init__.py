"""Framework-neutral runtime helpers for an agent deployed on Databricks (via ``databricks-mason[runtime]``).

These have no agent-framework dependency — MLflow tracing setup and workspace-routed SDK client
construction — so they work regardless of which framework an agent is built with. Framework-specific
helpers (session-store checkpointer, MCP tools, memory tools) live in the per-framework adapter
package, e.g. :mod:`databricks_mason.langgraph`, which re-exports these for a single import point.

``__all__`` is the supported surface. ``tool_manifest`` and ``session_store_client`` are internal and
reachable by their submodule paths but not re-exported here.

The re-exports below are resolved lazily (PEP 562) so importing a neutral submodule such as
``databricks_mason.runtime.tool_manifest`` does not pull in the tracing module's ``mlflow`` dependency.
